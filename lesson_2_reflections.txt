it will create a .git file which will store the snapshot of the commited files at every commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is an intermediate between working directory and the repository. 
using this u can add multiple files to the staging area and make the whole change as single commit
this way it helps to achive the idea of single commit per single logical change.
